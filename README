Description:

class GField:
    Containing a char and it's degree, determining it's order, this class represents a galois
    field. It stands the rule of three (copy c-tor, copy assignment operator and d-tor), and
    the following functions:
    static - isPrime: determining whether a given number is a prime or not.
    non-static - gcd: finds the gcd of two given GFNumbers.
                 createNumber: creates a GFNumber with the current GField and a given number.
                 Getters of the char, degree and the order.
    The class also overrides the == and != operators as well as << and >> operators.

class GFNumber:
    Containing a galois field and a number, a GFNumber overrides all arithmetic operators, so that
    calculating the prime factors of a given number in the field is possible. It uses the algorithms
    of Pollard's Rho and Brute Force to find this list and print it. It also stands the rule of
    three. It therefore has the following functions:
    static - _expandArray: given an array of GFNumbers, it adds another slot at the end of the array
             and returns it, taking care of memory allocations.
             _f: the given function for Rho's algorithm. This case, x^2 +1.
    non-static - _calcModulo: creates the correct representative of a given number in the field.
                 _pollardRho: the algorithm of pollard. It calculates a factor of a given number and
                 helping the program breaking the GFNumber into prime factors.
                 _bruteForce: when pollard's algorithm no longer works it does the trivial prime
                 factorization.
                 Getters of the field and the number.
                 getPrimeFactors: returns the calculated list of prime factors.
                 printFactors: prints the list by the correct method.
                 getIsPrime: determines if the current GFNumber is a prime number.
    The class overrides all arithmetic operators in order to make all functions mentioned above work
    properly under the galois field. It also has total order in it's field by overriding <,>,<=,>=,
    as well as the << and >> operators, and !=, ==.
    I decided to also add the /, /= operators in order to be able to divide two GFNumbers.
